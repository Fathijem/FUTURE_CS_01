# 1. What is Directory Traversal?
Directory Traversal (also known as Path Traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories outside the intended web root folder by manipulating file or directory path inputs.
This is usually achieved using sequences like:

``` perl
../
..\
%2e%2e%2f
```
These sequences move the file pointer up one or more directories in the server’s file system.

## 2. Impact
- Data Exposure – Reading sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, credentials).
- Information Gathering – Enumerating server directories for future attacks.
- System Compromise – Using retrieved data to escalate privileges or execute further exploits.

## 3.Attack Vector
The vulnerable URL in bWAPP:
http://localhost/bWAPP/directory_traversal_2.php?directory=documents

If the directory parameter is not sanitized, attackers can modify it to:

This moves up in the directory hierarchy and allows browsing server-side files and folders.

## 4. Vulnerability Scan
The vulnerability was identified by browsing the application through OWASP ZAP and scanning for common security issues. The scan indicated a Path Traversal weakness in the directory parameter.

## 5. How the Attack is Performed
Step-by-Step:
1. Identify input field or URL parameter
**Example:** directory=documents
2. Modify the parameter using ../ sequences to traverse directories.
**Example:** directory=../../../../
3. Observe if server responds with a list of directories or sensitive files.
4. Access potentially sensitive files (e.g., /etc/passwd, config files, logs).

**Example Screenshots:**
Normal View – Application listing files in the documents folder.

After changing directory=documents to directory=../../../

## 6. Prevention and Mitigation

| Method              | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Input Validation** | Reject `../` sequences and their encoded forms in parameters. |
| **Allowlist Access** | Only allow access to predefined safe directories and files. |
| **Use Secure APIs**  | Implement file-handling functions that restrict path navigation. |
| **Least Privilege**  | Run the web server with minimal OS permissions. |
| **WAF Filtering**    | Use a Web Application Firewall to block traversal patterns. |
